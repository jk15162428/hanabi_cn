## 规定

<br />

### Chop Moves（弃牌位挪移）

- 一般情况下，玩家们会弃掉他们最老的（最右侧的）未提示过的卡牌。然而，有时玩家可以知道一张未提示的卡牌是相当重要的。
- 「Chop Move」是一种特殊的操作，用来告诉一名玩家他现在 chop 上的未提示的卡牌是非常重要的。
- 在「Chop Move」后，那名玩家会认为自己的弃牌位被一个“隐形”的提示点到了。因此，他们的弃牌位会往左“挪移”，挪到下一张最右侧的，没有提示的卡牌。
- 「Chop Move」是永久的，就是说「Chop Moved」的卡在之后不应该被弃掉。（除非他们变成了废牌）
- 三种最为简单的「Chop Moves」将在下面讲解。
  （在进阶 6 和 7 中，会介绍另外两种常见的「Chop Moves」：
  「[Tempo Clue Chop Moves (TCCM)](level-6.mdx#the-tempo-clue-chop-move-tccm)」，和
  「[Scream Discard Chop Moves (SDCM)](level-7.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)」。）

<br />

## 特殊操作

<br />

### The Trash Chop Move

- 在游戏的中期，如果所有的 1 都已经被打出，而一名玩家提示了 1，这就有点奇怪。（根据「Good Touch Principle」，玩家不应该点到那些已经打过的卡牌。）这种情况下，1 都被认为是「Trash」（废牌）。
- 这个提示一定有更深层次的含义。我们认为废牌右侧的卡牌是重要的。这个提示的目的就是给那名玩家一张可以安全弃掉的牌。
- 然而，除了给出一个可以安全弃掉的牌外，这个提示也会「Chop Move」**所有**废牌右侧的牌。
- 比如说，在一局三人游戏中：
  - 所有的 1 都已经被打出。
  - Bob 手中没有任何提示过的卡牌。
  - Alice 向 Bob 提示了 1，点到了 4 号槽位。
  - Bob「Chop Move」自己的 5 号槽位。
  - Bob 弃掉了 1。
  - Bob 现在的 chop 变成了 4 号槽位。

<TrashChopMove1 />

- 大多数时间内，「Trash Chop Move」一般只会用来「Chop Move」一张卡（即废牌就在弃牌位旁边）。不过，你也可以一次性「Chop Move」多张牌。
- 比如说，在一局三人游戏中：
  - 所有的 1 都已经被打出。
  - Bob 手中没有任何提示过的卡牌。
  - Alice 向 Bob 提示了 1，点到了 1 号槽位的 1。
  - Bob「Chop Move」自己的 2 号、3 号、4 号和 5 号槽位（一次性「Chop Move」了四张牌）。
  - Bob 弃掉了 1。
  - Bob 现在的 chop 变成了 1 号槽位。

<TrashChopMove2 />

- 「Trash Chop Moves」通常使用数字 1 来启动，因为一般来说在游戏的中局，所有的 1 都已经被打出了。但只要所有的 2 都已经被打出/指明，那么数字 2 也能达到相同的目的。或者，当所有红色卡牌都被打出/指明时，也可以提示红色，以此类推。
- 从策略角度出发，「Trash Chop Move」主要应用在以下两个场合：
  1. 有时在某名玩家的弃牌位及弃牌位前的槽位上有着接连几张关键卡牌，一名玩家没法同时留下这些卡牌。在这种情况下，「Chop Move」可能就是唯一的解决方法。
  1. 有些卡牌（比如说「one-away-from-playable」的 3）可能在将来非常有用，但暂时“无法”直接点到它们（因为直接提示它们会意味着它们现在就可以打出）。如果游戏进展顺利，那“消耗”一个提示来永久地留下这些卡牌可能大有裨益。
- 注意你**不被**允许「Trash Chop Move」一张可以直接用「Save Clue」安全留下的卡牌（除非有连着几张关键卡牌而且你没有其他选择）。因为正向信息（positive information）永远要好过一张未知的卡牌。
- 如果「Trash Chop Move」点到了**多张**废牌，那就仅仅「Chop Moves」最右边的废牌往右的所有卡牌。
- 比如说，在一局三人游戏中：
  - 所有的 1 都已经被打出。
  - Bob 手中没有任何提示过的卡牌。
  - Alice 向 Bob 提示了数字 1，点到了 2 号槽位和 4 号槽位的两张 1。
  - Bob**只**「Chop Moves」自己的 5 号槽位。

<TrashChopMove3 />

<br />

### The 5's Chop Move (5CM)

- 通常而言，我们只允许直接保留在弃牌位上的 5（除非这是一个发生在「Early Game」和其他踏步情况下的「5 Stall」）。
- 所以说，如果一个数字 5 提示点到的并不是在弃牌位上的 5，而且现在**并不是**一个需要踏步的情况，那么这个提示看上去就是个 5 的「Play Clue」。
- 然而，如果那张 5 满足如下条件：
  - 与弃牌位只有**一张**的距离（或者如果有多张 5 被点到，且最右侧的那张 5 离弃牌位只有一张的距离），而且
  - 弃牌位上的牌并不是一张废牌。
- 那么，我们规定这个提示有一个特殊的含义，即这个提示完全**不是**一个「Play Clue」。
- 反之，我们认为这个提示是一个「5's Chop Move」，那名被提示的玩家应该与之前「Trash Chop Move」一样进行「Chop Move」。
- 比如说，在一局三人游戏中：
  - 所有的 1 都已经被打出。
  - Bob 手中没有任何提示过的卡牌。
  - Alice 向 Bob 提示了数字 5，点到了 4 号槽位的一张 5。
  - Bob 要「Chop Move」自己 5 号槽位的卡牌，现在他新的弃牌位是 3 号槽位。

<FivesChopMove1 />

- 与「Trash Chop Move」类似，如果一个「5's Chop Move」点到了**多张**5，那么我们只「Chop Move」最右侧的 5 右边的那张卡。
- 比如说，在一局三人游戏中：
  - 所有的 1 都已经被打出。
  - Bob 手中没有任何提示过的卡牌。
  - Alice 向 Bob 提示了数字 5，点到了 2 号槽位和 4 号槽位的 2 张 5。
  - Bob**只**「Chop Move」自己 5 号槽位的卡牌。Bob 现在新的弃牌位是 3 号槽位。

<FivesChopMove2 />

- Note that the _5's Chop Move_ is different than the _Trash Chop Move_ in that you can only chop move **one** card with it. Thus, if you clue a 5 and it is **two** (or more) slots away from the chop, then it is to be assumed to be a _Play Clue_ on the 5.
  - When counting how far away from chop a card is, you should only look at **unclued** cards.
- Remember that _5 Stalls_ takes precedence over _5's Chop Moves_. Thus, if a number 5 clue **could** just be a _5 Stall_ (e.g. it is the _Early Game_), then it should not _Chop Move_ anything.
  - Technically, one could try to analyze whether a clue is a _5 Stall_ or _5's Chop Move_ by looking at whether the clue-giver had a different clue to give, since _5 Stalls_ are only permitted if all "normal" _Play Clues_ and _Save Clues_ have been extinguished. However, this analysis relies on asymmetric information, and can be confusing even for experienced players. So, this move is not introduced until [level 19](level-19.mdx#special-moves).
- For level 19+ players, see the _[Early 5's Chop Move](level-19.mdx#the-early-5s-chop-move)_.
- For level 22+ players, there are [additional rules](level-22.mdx#interaction-with-5-rank-clues) relating to the _5's Chop Move_.

<br />

### The Order Chop Move (OCM)

- First, see the section on [Playing Multiple 1's](level-3.mdx#playing-multiple-1s).
- We agree that unknown 1's are supposed to be played in a particular order. If a player has unknown 1's and does **not** play them in the correct order, it means that they are trying to send an additional message.
- If a player skips over **one** of the 1's, and there is nothing else special going on, it means that the next player should _Chop Move_ one card.
- If a player skips over **two** of the 1s, the message skips over the next player, and the player after that should _Chop Move_ one card.
- A skip of **three** 1's means that the player three seats away should _Chop Move_, and so on.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Bob number 1, which touches three 1's. They are in slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  - Bob is expected to play slot 3 (which is the oldest 1). If he plays slot 3, nothing special happens.
  - If Bob plays slot 2, then he is skipping over one card. Cathy should _Chop Move_ one card (her slot 5).
  - If Bob plays slot 1, he is skipping over two cards. Alice should _Chop Move_ one card (her slot 5).

<OrderChopMove />

- If a player decides to do an _Order Chop Move_, on their next turn, they should revert to the original order again.
- For example, continuing from the previous example:
  - Bob decides to play slot 2, performing an _Order Chop Move_ on Cathy.
  - Cathy marks her slot 5 card as being _Chop Moved_. Then, Cathy gives an unrelated clue.
  - Alice gives an unrelated clue.
  - Now, Bob has two 1's left in slot 2 and slot 3.
  - Bob is expected to play slot 3 (which is the oldest 1). If he plays slot 3, nothing special happens.
  - If Bob plays slot 2, he is performing another _Order Chop Move_, and Cathy should _Chop Move_ one card. (It would be her slot 4, since her slot 5 is already _Chop Moved_.)
- There are some other common situations that do **not** imply an _Order Chop Move_. Use your common sense! Here is a short list:
  - The 1 that was played has a **different amount of positive clues** than the other 1's. (Different negative clues are ignored.)
  - The 1 that was played was originally _Finessed_ from a clue that happened **before** the number 1 clue.
  - The 1 that was skipped over is known to be bad from contextual information.
- The _Order Chop Move_ only applies to 1s. If it happens with any card that is not a 1, then it is never an _Order Chop Move_ and it just means nothing.

<br />

## General Principles

<br />

### Chop Moves as a Category

- As a matter of terminology, _Chop Moves_ do not count as _Save Clues_ - they exist in a separate category.
- This is because the _Chop Move_ is not a message about the touched card directly - it is a referential clue that talks about a different card.

<br />

### Chop Moves & New Clues

- Once a card has been _Chop Moved_ and is no longer in danger of being discarded, it is treated as an already-clued card with regards to new clues given to that hand.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's have been played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a 1 in his slot 4.
  - Bob _Chop Moves_ his slot 5.
  - Bob discards the 1.
  - Bob's chop is now his slot 4.
  - Cathy clues blue to Bob, which touches his slot 1 (the card he just drew) and his slot 5 (the card that was just _Chop Moved_).
  - Bob knows that the focus of the clue is always on the new card introduced, so this is **not** chop-focus, and the focus of the clue is on slot 1.
  - Thus, Bob will play blue 2 from slot 1 on his next turn.

<ChopMoveNew />

- The exception to the above rule is if a clue is given that touches a _Chop Moved_ card for the first time and only "old" cards are touched. In this case, the focus is on the left-most _Chop Moved_ card that was touched by the clue.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the rainbow variant:
  - All the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has an unknown red card on slot 3, an unknown red card on slot 4, and a _Chop Moved_ card in slot 5 (that is completely unclued).
  - Alice clues blue to Bob, which touches slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5. (Slot 3 and slot 4 are "filled in" to be rainbow cards and slot 5 is now a true blue card.)
  - Bob knows that the focus of the clue is normally on the new card introduced, but all three of the cards that were touched were "old".
  - Bob knows that when old cards are re-touched, the focus of the clue is the left-most of those cards.
  - However, Bob also knows that this is the exception to the rule. In this specific case, putting a positive clue on the _Chop Moved_ card was more important than filling in the rainbow cards, so by convention the focus of the clue is his slot 5.

<ChopMoveNewException />

<br />

### Chop Moves & Prompts

- _Chop Moves_ interact with _Prompts_ & _Finesses_ in a potentially confusing way. _Chop Moved_ cards should **not** be played into _Prompts_, even though they are imagined to have an "invisible" clue on them.
- For example:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has no cards clued in his hand, but he is _Chop Moved_ for a mystery card on his slot 5.
  - Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 3.
  - Bob knows that he is promised the red 2. If this is a _Finesse_, then he has the red 2 on his _Finesse Position_ (slot 1).
  - However, Bob is also _Chop Moved_ for a card. Bob knows that _Chop Moved_ cards have an "invisible" clue around them, and Bob also knows that _Prompts_ are said to take precedence over _Finesses_.
  - So should he play his slot 1 as a _Finesse_ or his slot 5 as a _Prompt_? In this situation, Bob knows that _Prompts_ do not apply to _Chop Moved_ cards, so Bob should play his slot 1.

## Common Mistakes

<br />

### Critical Discards after a Chop Move (Mistake)

- If a player _Chop Moves_ a card, and then the next time they discard, they discard a critical card, then obviously some kind of mistake occurred.
- The best explanation is that the _Chop Move_ was never intended in the first place.
- Thus, when this happens, the player should "undo" the _Chop Move_.

<br />

### Undoing an Accidental Chop Move (Mistake)

- Often times a player can misinterpret a clue as a _Chop Move_ when it really had some other meaning. If this happens, after they discard their new _Chop_, everyone else on the team will know that an accidental _Chop Move_ has occurred.
- Later on in the game, sometimes a player in this situation can retroactively realize that they have made a mistake by _Chop Moving_ earlier on. They might be tempted to shift their chop back to where it is supposed to be.
- However, unless they discard a critical card (see the above section), players should **not ever undo a _Chop Move_**, because they could be discarding a now-critical card that was not critical at the time of the original mistake. Everyone else on the team did not bother to clue the now-critical card, because they thought it was safely _Chop Moved_.
