- 这个进阶引入了「Priority」（优先级），需要玩家时刻注意其他玩家打牌的顺序。
- 这可能需要一点时间才能融会贯通，因为「Priority」的启动标志非常容易漏掉。
- 请确保你在尝试把「Priority」加入对局中前已经基本掌握了前面的所有进阶。（我们推荐至少要有 250-300 局对局经验。）

## 特殊操作

<br />

### The Priority Prompt & The Priority Finesse

- 一般来说，玩家某一时刻只会有一张牌要打。这种情况下，除非有什么特别好的提示可以给，否则没什么需要思考的 - 他们只需要打自己那张牌就好了。
- 但如果一名玩家有两张或更多的牌可以打呢？他们应该先打哪张牌呢？
- 如果一张牌还没有完全明了（比如一张可以打出但未知颜色的 2），那玩家也许想要先打那张牌，好搞清楚它究竟是什么。正常情况下，**如果玩家打出一张未知的卡牌，不会启动什么特殊的操作。**
- 换句话说，如果一名玩家打出了明牌，那就**可以**启动一些特殊的操作，因为他们很清楚自己在做什么。我们规定**可以打的牌应该按照一定的顺序打出**。我们将这成为「Priority」（优先级）。规定的「Priority」如下：

| 优先级 | 牌的类型                           | 理由                                                 | 能否做别的事情 |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1      | 需要盲打的牌                       | 告诉其他玩家这是「Finesse」或「Bluff」是非常重要的。 | ❌             |
| 2      | 能够连上其他玩家手中提示过的牌的牌 | 否则，队伍会损失「Tempo」。                          | ✅             |
| 3      | 能够连上自己手中提示过的牌的牌     | 一名玩家“持有”多张同花色的牌要打并不好。             | ✅             |
| 4      | 所有的 5                           | 打出 5 会给队伍一个免费的提示。                      | ✅             |
| 5      | 数字更低的牌                       | 低数字的牌更应该先打出。                             | ✅             |
| 6      | 仍有未知信息的卡牌                 | 获得自己手牌的信息是很有价值的。                     | ✅             |
| 7      | 最左端的牌                         | 最左端的牌更有可能是好的牌。                         | ✅             |

- 如果一名玩家打出一张明牌，并且这张牌**不**具有「Priority」，那么这名玩家肯定是想传递额外的信息。
- 基于他打出了什么牌，如果你手中提示过的牌有能够“承上”的牌，这就是一个告诉你可以立刻打出的信号，这被称为「Priority Prompt」。（与寻常的「Prompt」类似，除了寻常的「Prompt」用提示启动，而现在是用打牌的顺序启动的。）
- 比如说，在一局三人游戏中：
  - Alice 有一张提示过并已经明了的可打的红 1，和一张提示过并已经明了的可打的蓝 2。Bob 的手上有两张提示过的 3。
  - Alice 打出了蓝 2。
  - 轮到 Bob 的回合。Bob 知道正常情况下 Alice 应该会选择打数字更小的牌 - 红 1（除非这是张盲打的牌，或者连上其他玩家的手牌，或者是张 5）。Alice **并没有**打有「Priority」的那张牌。
  - Bob 没有看见 Cathy 手里有蓝 3。这肯定是一个「Priority Prompt」。Bob 打出了左边的那张 3，这是一张蓝 3。

<PriorityPrompt />

- 与寻常的「Prompt」类似，如果「Priority Prompt」指向了两张或更多提示过的牌，那你应该打最左边的。
- 与寻常的「Prompt」类似，如果「Priority Prompt」让你打出了最左边的牌且它并不是那张过渡牌，那你应该继续打出提示过的牌，直到你找到为止。
- 或者说，如果你手上没有牌可以接上他们打的牌，那你应该认为这是个「Priority Finesse」，打出自己「Finesse Position」上的牌。
- 比如说，在一局三人游戏中：
  - Alice 手中有一张提示过的明牌红 1 和一张明牌蓝 2（都可以打出）。
  - Alice 打出了蓝 2。
  - 轮到 Bob 的回合。Bob 知道通常情况下，当你有两张牌可以选择打出时，你应该打数字最低的那张（除非这是张盲打牌，或其他优先级更高的操作）。Bob 知道 Alice 理应打出红 1 而不是蓝 2。Alice**没有**打出带有「Priority」的那张牌。
  - Bob 看到 Cathy 的「Finesse Position」上有一张蓝 3。这意味着 Alice 是在启动一个对 Cathy 的「Priority Finesse」，而不是对 Bob 的。Bob 做了些无关紧要的事。
  - Cathy 打出「Finesse Position」上的牌，这是一张蓝 3。

### The Priority Bluff

- Similar to a normal _Bluff_, it is also possible for players to perform a _Priority Bluff_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice has a known playable red 1 and a known playable blue 2 in her hand.
  - Alice plays blue 2.
  - Bob comes next. Bob knows that normally, when you have a choice between two cards, you are supposed to play the lowest rank card. (Unless it is a blind-play, or it leads into someone's hand, or it is a 5.) Bob does not see any blue 3's, so he knows that Alice was supposed to play the red 1 instead of the blue 2. Alice **did not** play the card with _Priority_.
  - This means that Bob must have a blue 3. Bob does not have any clued cards in his hand, so he blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is **not** the blue 3 and is instead the green 1. Bob now knows that he was _Bluffed_ and that no-one has the blue 3.

### A Priority Flowchart (for Choosing Between 2+ Playable Cards)

_Priority_ can be confusing. [Here is a flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/main/static/img/flowcharts/priority-flowchart.png) that shows, in general, which card should be played when there is a choice between two cards.

[Here is another flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/main/static/img/flowcharts/priority-unknown-flowchart.png) that shows how _Priority_ works when one or more of the cards is unknown.

<br />

### Situations Where Priority Does Not Apply

Priority does not always apply. Some common exceptions are listed below.

#### 1) _End-Game_

- _Priority_ is generally "turned off" in the _End-Game_, because players often need to play specific cards.
- With that said, _Priority_ can still work if a player plays a card that would be really terrible for the team otherwise.

#### 2) The 4's Priority Exception

- If a player has a known playable 5 and a known playable 4 that leads into their own hand, then according to the above _Priority_ table, the known playable 4 would have _Priority_. However, this does not make much sense, since the 5 has to be played no matter what, playing the 5 gives the team a clue back, the 4 could be distributed to someone else, and so on.
- Thus, if a player has a known playable 5 and a known playable 4 that leads into their own hand, then the 5 is said to have _Priority_.

#### 3) Blind-Playing Globally-Known Cards

- Normally, blind-playing cards has _Priority_ over everything else.
- However, in some advanced cases, the blind-play does not need to be demonstrated to the team - everyone already has full knowledge of what is going on. In this case, players are supposed to treat the cards as clued for the purposes of finding the _Priority_. (The _Gentleman's Discard_ on a non-1 is the main move that this applies to.)

#### 4) "Important" Cards

- Normally, cards that are the same rank should be played from left-to-right.
- However, in certain situations, players can know that some **other** card is **more important** than the left-most card. If a player plays a "more important" card, it should never trigger a "right-to-left" style _Priority Finesse_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - In the _Early Game_, Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching three 2's on slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 (his chop). (This is the _2 Save_ convention.)
  - Later on in the game, all of the 1's are now played on the stacks.
  - Bob has not received any other clues since then - all of his 2's are known playable, but he has no idea what color they are.
  - Normally, Bob knows that he is supposed to play his 2's from left-to-right. However, he also knows that his 2 on slot 5 is the most important card out of all of them - it was the focus of the original _2 Save_ by Alice.
  - Thus, Bob plays his 2 on slot 5 first. After that, he plays the 2's from left-to-right like normal.

<br />

### Playing Into Someone Else's Hand

- For the purposes of playing into someone else's hand, we only consider what the very next card is, in order to keep things simple.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice has a globally-known blue 3, red 3, and red 4.
  - Bob has a globally-known blue 4.
  - Cathy has a globally-known red 5.
  - Here, Alice knows that when playing cards into other player's hands, she is only supposed to consider what the very next card is.
  - Thus, Alice plays the blue 3 into Bob's blue 4.

<PriorityIntoSomeoneElsesHand />

- The obvious exception to this rule is if one of the players on the team is locked. In this situation, it is better to work towards unlocking that player.

<br />

### The Load Clue

- Players will generally play cards without _Priority_ if they see the next card in someone else's _Finesse Position_, because this will get the card for "free" as a _Priority Finesse_.
- Less commonly, players will see the next card in someone else's hand, but it will not be in _Finesse Position_. In these cases, it might still be good to play the card without _Priority_, just so that the player with the next card will have something to do on their turn.
- However, if they do play the card without _Priority_, it will cause an impending misplay because the target player will think the card is actually on their _Finesse Position_. Thus, doing this **forces** someone to give a clue to the card directly in order to stop the misplay.
- This clue is similar to a _Fix Clue_, since it fixes an impending misplay. But we specifically call this kind of clue a _Load Clue_ to differentiate it from a _Fix Clue_ that fixes a _Lie_ or mistake. It is a _Load Clue_ because it is loading the player who received the clue with something to do on their turn.
- Note that a _Load Clue_ applies even if the clue would like a _Save Clue_ otherwise. (In other words, the card promised from the _Priority_ move has to be _somewhere_.)
- If you receive a _Load Clue_, you should suspect that you might have something valuable on your chop, as this would be an excellent reason to commit the team to giving the _Load Clue_ in the first place.
- If a player has a choice between playing one card that leads nowhere and playing one card that commits the team to giving a _Load Clue_, then they are not obligated to choose one or the other - they can choose whichever one is best for the situation.
- When a player receives a _Load Clue_, they are to interpret it as a normal _Play Clue_ instead of a _Fix Clue_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a choice between playing a known red 2 or a known blue 2. The red 2 has _Priority_ because it is the left-most card.
  - Alice plays the blue 2.
  - Bob sees that Cathy's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: yellow 4, yellow 3, yellow 4, red 1, blue 3.
  - Bob sees that Cathy will think that Alice is performing a _Priority Finesse_ on the blue 3. Thus, Bob must now give a _Load Clue_ to stop the impending misplay.
  - Bob clues number 3 to Cathy.
  - Cathy is surprised - she was about to play her _Finesse Position_ card as a blue 3, but she now knows that it can't be a blue 3.
  - If this was a _Fix Clue_, Cathy might be inclined to play the card that was closest to her slot 1 (which would be the 3 on slot 2).
  - However, Cathy knows that _Load Clues_ are to be interpreted as normal _Play Clues_ instead of _Fix Clues_, so she interprets this as a normal _Chop-Focus Play Clue_ and plays blue 3 from slot 5.

### The Layered Priority Finesse

- Similar to a normal _Layered Finesse_, it is also possible to initiate a _Layered Priority Finesse_ as long as the blind-playing player is not the very next person.

<br />

### The Priority Finesse (Special Case)

- To review, if a player has two playable cards, and both of them are fully-known, then they always have the ability to trigger a _Priority Finesse_.
- If a player has two playable cards, and only one of them is fully-known, a _Priority Finesse_ will never be triggered if they play the unknown card.
- But what if a player plays a fully-known card over an unknown card? They **can still** trigger a _Priority Finesse_, but **only** if every single possibility for the unknown card would have _Priority_ over the card that was played.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks. The 1's are played on all of the other stacks.
  - Alice has a globally-known red 3. (She was given a _Play Clue_ on it earlier.)
  - Alice has a 2 of unknown color. (She was given a _Save Clue_ on it earlier, but it is now playable since all of the 1's are down.)
  - Alice's 2 could be either blue 2, green 2, yellow 2, or purple 2.
  - The rest of the team does not have any clued cards in their hands.
  - Alice knows that **all** of the possibilities for the 2 would have _Priority_ over the red 3, since all of them are lower rank.
  - Alice plays the red 3 anyway, which triggers a _Priority Finesse_ on the red 4.

<PriorityFinesseSpecial />

### The Trust Finesse (A Situational Priority Finesse)

- According to the _Priority_ rules, if an unknown card is played, no _Priority Finesse_ can be triggered.
- However, even if this is the case, if playing one of the cards over the other would be really dumb, it should still trigger a _Finesse_.
- This type of move is called a _Trust Finesse_ to distinguish it from the case where the card is globally known.
- It is also possible to perform a _Trust Prompt_, a _Trust Bluff_, and so forth.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice has two playable cards in her hand:
    - One of the cards has a red clue on it. Since it was originally clued as a _Play Clue_, it is globally known that Alice knows that this is exactly red 2.
    - One of the cards has a number 2 clue on it. Since it was originally clued with a _Save Clue_, it can be any non-red 2. But it is playable because all of the 1's are already played.
  - Bob has a clued and globally known red 3 in his hand.
  - Alice knows that she is expected to play her red 2 into Bob's red 3, because that would be good teamwork.
  - Unknown from the rest of the team, Alice knows from the context of the game that her 2 must be exactly blue 2.
  - Bob has blue 3 on his _Finesse Position_.
  - Alice plays the globally unknown 2 to cause a _Trust Finesse_.

<TrustFinesse />

### The Paused Priority Finesse

- For the purposes of _Priority_, blind-playing a card is the most important thing to do. When players are supposed to be blind-playing a card, they are usually **not** allowed to perform a _Priority Finesse_ - they must stick to playing the blind card.
- One exception to this is if a player is in the middle of unraveling the layer of a _Layered Finesse_. Since they have already blind-played their first card in the layer, they have demonstrated that the _Finesse_ was on them, and now everyone on the team knows that the rest of the cards inside of the layer are "gotten" for sure.
- Thus, in this situation, a player can "pause" finishing up the _Layered Finesse_ and play some other clued card to perform a _Priority Finesse_. This is called a _Paused Priority Finesse_.
- Note that this only applies when the card that was blind-played was unrelated to the original _Layered Finesse_.
  - For example, if a player is finessed for both the red 1 and the red 2 and has just blind-played a green 1, then they can perform a _Priority Finesse_, because everyone on the team knows that the green 1 played as red 1 and therefore that the layer is not yet unraveled.
  - However, if a player is finessed for both the red 1 and the red 2 and has just blind-played the red 1, then they **cannot** perform a _Paused Priority Finesse_ because they haven't demonstrated to the team that they are still finessed for the red 2.
