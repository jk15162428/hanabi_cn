However, there are limits - they are not allowed to just clue anything they want. These are the specific clues that they are allowed to give along with the precedence of each clue:</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>Precedence</th><th>Type of Clue</th><th>Normal Situation (Severity 0)</th><th>Early Game (Severity 1)</th><th>Double Discard / Scream Discard (Severity 2)</th><th>Locked Hand (Severity 3)</th><th>8 Clues (Severity 4)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Normal <em>Play Clues</em> or normal <em>Save Clues</em></td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><em>5 Stall</em><br>(cluing off chop 5&#x27;s)</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><em>Tempo Clue Stall</em><br>(re-cluing a card to make it play)</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>4 (tied)</td><td><em>Locked Hand Save</em><br>(saving any card on chop, as long as doing so would not <em>Lock</em> the other player)</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>4 (tied)</td><td><em>8 Clue Save</em><br>(saving any card not on slot 1)</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>4 (tied)</td><td><em>Fill-In Clue</em><br>(giving extra information to already-clued cards or <em>Chop Moved</em> cards)</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><em>Hard Burn</em><br>(re-cluing an unplayable card that gives no new information, usually a 5)</td><td>❌</td><td>❌</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>For example:<ul><li>It is the <em>Early Game</em> (severity 1).</li><li>Alice does not have any normal <em>Play Clues</em> or <em>Save Clues</em> to give (precedence 1).</li><li>Alice does not have any <em>5 Stalls</em> to give (precedence 2).</li><li>Alice does have a <em>Tempo Clue</em> to give (precedence 3), but <em>Tempo Clue Stalls</em> are not valid in the Early Game. Thus, if Alice gives a <em>Tempo Clue</em>, it would instead be interpreted as a <em>Tempo Clue Chop Move</em>.</li><li>Thus, since Alice does not want to cause a <em>Tempo Clue Chop Move</em>, she must discard.</li></ul></li><li>For example:<ul><li>The team has 8 clues (severity 4).</li><li>Alice does not have any normal <em>Play Clues</em> or <em>Save Clues</em> to give (precedence 1).</li><li>Alice does not have any <em>5 Stalls</em> to give (precedence 2).</li><li>Alice does have a <em>Tempo Clue</em> to give (precedence 3).</li><li>Thus, Alice must perform the <em>Tempo Clue</em>. It will be interpreted as a <em>Tempo Clue Stall</em> (and will not have a <em>Chop Move</em> component). Furthermore, Alice is not allowed to do any moves with precedence 4 or 5.</li></ul></li><li>What is the point of having a complicated table with defined priorities? Well, normally, players in stalling situations are not able to give tricky-looking <em>Finesses</em>, because everyone else will think that they are just giving a stall clue. However, if it can be seen that there is a better clue available for them to give, then everyone can know that they are <strong>not</strong> giving a stall clue. So, because of this precedence table, players in stalling situations are still often able to make <em>Finesses</em> happen.</li><li>Obviously, stall clues are not allowed when the player has a known playable card in their hand.</li></ul><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-early-game-severity-1-stalling">The Early Game (Severity 1 Stalling)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-early-game-severity-1-stalling" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>The <em>Early Game</em> is introduced in the <a href="/hanabi_cn/docs/beginner/early-game">beginner&#x27;s guide</a>.

We don&#x27;t bother telling the extra rules to beginners because they deal with some edge-case situations. We have the extra rules because we want to &quot;squeeze&quot; as much value out of the conventions as possible.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="ending-the-early-game">Ending the Early Game<a class="hash-link" href="#ending-the-early-game" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li>The <em>Early Game</em> is only ended when the first <strong>completely unknown</strong> card is discarded.</li><li>In other words:<ul><li>Misplaying a card <strong>does not count</strong> as ending the <em>Early Game</em>.</li><li>Discarding known-trash <strong>does not count</strong> as ending the <em>Early Game</em>.</li><li>Doing special discards that &quot;transfer&quot; cards to other players <strong>does not count</strong> as ending the <em>Early Game</em>.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="extinguishing-every-clue">Extinguishing Every Clue<a class="hash-link" href="#extinguishing-every-clue" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li>Extinguishing every clue <strong>does</strong> include <em>5 Stalling</em>, but it is only mandatory for the team to collectively perform one <em>5 Stall</em>. If one <em>5 Stall</em> clue has already been given and there is another <em>5 Stall</em> clue available, players are allowed to clue it if they want, but they don&#x27;t have to.</li><li>Extinguishing every clue <strong>does not</strong> include cluing something in the hand of the player who came directly before. See the <em><a href="#permission-to-discard-ptd">Permission to Discard</a></em> section.</li><li>Extinguishing every clue <strong>does not</strong> include giving <em>Tempo Clues</em> (e.g. clues that do not meet <em>Minimum Clue Value Principle</em>).</li><li>Extinguishing every clue <strong>does not</strong> include cluing cards that will be almost certainly be <em>Order Chop Moved</em> by an upcoming player who already has two or more 1&#x27;s clued in their hand.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="permission-to-discard-ptd">Permission to Discard (PTD)<a class="hash-link" href="#permission-to-discard-ptd" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li>Normally, you have to &quot;extinguish&quot; every <em>Play Clue</em> and <em>Save Clue</em> before ending the <em>Early Game</em>.</li><li>However, there are several exceptions, which are listed in the <a href="#extinguishing-every-clue">Extinguishing Every Clue</a> section.</li><li>The most important exception is that you are not required to clue the hand of the player who came directly before you. Players in this situation can clue the previous player if they want, or they can discard if they want - it&#x27;s up to them.</li><li>This is because if Alice does not see any <em>Play Clues</em> or <em>Save Clues</em> for Bob to give, then Alice is implicitly giving Bob <em>Permission to Discard</em> (or PTD for short).</li><li>For level 10 players, note that <em>Permission to Discard</em> does not apply for Bob when Alice was blind-playing a card in a situation where <em>Guide Principle</em> applies.</li></ul><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="double-discard-situations--double-discard-avoidance-dda-severity-2-stalling">Double Discard Situations / Double Discard Avoidance (DDA) (Severity 2 Stalling)<a class="hash-link" href="#double-discard-situations--double-discard-avoidance-dda-severity-2-stalling" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Often times in Hanabi, two players will discard in a row. However, in rare cases, this can cause a perfect score to be lost.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Alice has nothing to do. Alice discards her chop and it is a red 4.</li><li>Bob has nothing to do. Bob also has a completely unclued hand. Bob discards his chop and it is the other copy of the red 4.</li><li>Since both copies of the red 4 are discarded, it is no longer possible to get a perfect score. (The maximum score now is 23 instead of 25.)</li><li>Normally, someone on the team would give a <em>Save Clue</em> to Bob&#x27;s red 4 before it could get discarded. But since Bob&#x27;s turn was immediately after Alice&#x27;s turn, no-one on the team had time to save it.</li></ul></li><li>In the previous example, on Bob&#x27;s turn, since Bob <em>could</em> have the red 4 on his chop, we would say that Bob is in a <em>Double Discard Situation</em> for the red 4.</li><li>More formally, a <em>Double Discard Situation</em> is defined as when:<ol><li>the previous player discards or misplays a card</li><li><strong>and</strong> the current player could be discarding the other copy of that card.</li></ol></li><li>Players agree to <strong>never</strong> discard in a <em>Double Discard Situation</em> if it has the potential to lower the maximum score. Instead, they must give some clue. This is called <em>Double Discard Avoidance</em>, or DDA for short.</li><li>If a player in DDA has no normal <em>Play Clues</em> or <em>Save Clues</em> to give, then they are allowed to give &quot;stall&quot; clues, like a <em>5 Stall</em>. If there are no <em>5 Stalls</em> to give, they can even just &quot;fill-in&quot; some information on an already-clued card (and doing this should not be read as a <em>Play Clue</em> or a <em>Finesse</em> or anything like that).</li><li>Let&#x27;s revisit the above example to show what Bob should have done:<ul><li>Alice has nothing to do. Alice discards her chop and it is a red 4.</li><li>Bob has nothing to do (meaning that there are no normal <em>Play Clues</em> or <em>Save Clues</em> to give). Bob also has a completely unclued hand.</li><li>Bob&#x27;s chop is his slot 5 card. Since Bob does not see the red 4 in anyone else&#x27;s hand and Bob&#x27;s slot 5 card has no positive or negative clues on it, it is possible that Bob&#x27;s slot 5 card could be the red 4. Thus, Bob knows that he is currently in a <em>Double Discard Situation</em> for the red 4.</li><li>Since there are no normal <em>Play Clues</em> or <em>Save Clues</em> available, Bob looks around to see if he can give a <em>5 Stall</em>. Bob sees that Cathy has a red 5 on her slot 1, so he clues number 5 to Cathy as a <em>5 Stall</em>.</li><li>Cathy knows that since Bob was in a <em>Double Discard Situation</em> for the red 4, she should not read too closely into his clues. This number 5 clue must just be a <em>5 Stall</em> (as opposed to a <em>Play Clue</em> on the 5).</li></ul></li></ul><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="locked-hands-severity-3-stalling">Locked Hands (Severity 3 Stalling)<a class="hash-link" href="#locked-hands-severity-3-stalling" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Generally speaking, it is a bad situation when someone&#x27;s hand gets fully clued. This is also known as being <em>Locked</em>, and it should be avoided if possible. However, sometimes it cannot be helped, like when a player draws three 5&#x27;s in a row.</li><li>A player with a <em>Locked Hand</em> may give a low-value clue because they are not sure that they can play anything (and they can&#x27;t discard because their hand is fully clued). Similar to a <em>Double Discard</em> situation, players should not read too closely into any clues given during this state.</li><li>If the team is out of clues and someone&#x27;s hand is fully clued, then you <strong>have</strong> to discard to generate a clue for them. Similarly, if there is only 1 clue left, you cannot steal it from them.</li></ul><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="clues-given-while-at-8-clues-severity-4-stalling">Clues Given While at 8 Clues (Severity 4 Stalling)<a class="hash-link" href="#clues-given-while-at-8-clues-severity-4-stalling" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>At the beginning of the game, you start with 8 clues. This section only applies to situations where you climb to 8 clues in the middle of the game.</li><li>A player who has a turn with 8 clue tokens available may give a low-value clue because they cannot play anything (and they cannot discard because the game does not allow you to discard while at 8 clues). Similar to a <em>Double Discard</em> or a <em>Locked Hand</em> situation, players should not read too closely into any clues given during this state.</li></ul><br><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="special-moves">Special Moves<a class="hash-link" href="#special-moves" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-5-stall-intermediate-section">The 5 Stall (Intermediate Section)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-5-stall-intermediate-section" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>As mentioned in the <a href="/hanabi_cn/docs/level-2#the-5-stall-cluing-off-chop-5s5%E8%B8%8F%E6%AD%A5">level 2</a>, <em>5 Stalls</em> are when a player clues an off chop 5 purely because they want (or need) to give a stall clue.</li><li><em>5 Stalls</em> are usually performed in the <em>Early Game</em>. Less commonly, they can also be performed in the <em>Mid-Game</em> if a player happens to be in a special &quot;stalling&quot; situation where they are not allowed to discard.</li><li>In the <em>Early Game</em>, the team can give as many <em>5 Stalls</em> as they want before initiating the <em>Mid-Game</em>.</li><li>Regardless of whether they are done in the <em>Early Game</em> or the <em>Mid-Game</em>, <em>5 Stalls</em> are only allowed if there is nothing else &quot;normal&quot; to do (like playing a card, giving a normal <em>Play Clue</em>, or giving a normal <em>Save Clue</em>).<ul><li>However, see the <em>Finesse Position Exception</em> section below.</li></ul></li><li><em>5 Stalls</em> <strong>must</strong> be given to the 5 that is closest to chop. For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>It is the <em>Early Game</em>. The only thing left for Alice to do is to clue an off chop 5.</li><li>Bob has two playable 1&#x27;s on slots 1 and 2. He has a green 5 on slot 4. Bob&#x27;s 5 is therefore one-away from chop.</li><li>Cathy has nothing clued in her hand. She has a purple 5 on slot 3. Cathy&#x27;s 5 is therefore two-away from chop.</li><li>Alice must clue number 5 to Bob as a <em>5 Stall</em> since his 5 is closer to chop (even though Bob has two playable cards).</li></ul></li></ul><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" baseProfile="full" height="375" viewBox="0 0 944 375" width="944"
