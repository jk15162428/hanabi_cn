These conventions apply to the "Number Blind" variants.

### Number Clues --> Slot Numbers

- Color clues mean the same thing as normal.
- All number clues mean to play the corresponding slot.
- If there are only four cards in the hand and a number 5 clue is used, that means to *Chop Move*.

### The Mismatch Finesse

- If a player has two of the same playable card in their hand, players are expected to give a positional *Play Clue* to the left-most one.
- If a player instead gives a positional *Play Clue* to the right-most one, then they are trying to communicate something extra.
- This means that the next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position* as any unrelated playable card.
- *Mismatch Finesses* can also rarely give a player a safe discard.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy has a red 1 in slot 1 and another red 1 in slot 2.
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, giving a *Play Clue* to Cathy's slot 2.
  - Bob knows that since Cathy had a duplicate card on slot 1 and slot 2, Alice was supposed to get the left-most card, the slot 1.
  - Alice must be doing the *Mismatch Finesse*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position*, and it is a blue 1.
  - Cathy assumes that Alice did a *Finesse* - due to Bob's blind-play, she must have the blue 2 in her slot 2. Cathy plays her slot 2, and it is revealed to be red 1.
  - Cathy now knows that it was not a normal *Finesse* at all - it was instead a *Mismatch Finesse*, because there is no other explanation for why Bob would blind-play from a *Play Clue* on a red 1.
  - Cathy also knows that she must have another red 1 in her hand. Since there is only one card to the left of her slot 2, she knows that the red 1 has to be exactly in her slot 1 (at the time of the clue).
  - Due to this, when Cathy needs to discard next, she will blind-discard her slot 2 card (since slot 1 has now shifted down to slot 2 after she played the red 1).

### Advanced Conventions

- In Number Blind variants, *Ejections* and *Discharges* work quite differently. See the [Specific Conventions for Variants with No Positive Clues](no-positive-clues.md).
