These conventions apply to the "Throw It in a Hole" variants.

<br />

### Hard Variant

- Throw It in a Hole is considered to be a hard variant, meaning that *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned on" and so forth.

### No Bluffs

- *Bluffs* are turned off.
- It is okay to perform a *Trash Finesse* for the final card of a particular rank or suit, but *Trash Bluffs* are turned off.

### Priority Changes

- Since 5's do not give a clue back, then they do not have *Priority* over other cards in the same way that they normally do.
