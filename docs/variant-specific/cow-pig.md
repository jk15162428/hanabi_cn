These conventions apply to the "Cow & Pig" variants.

<br />

### No Color Saves

- Rank clues (oink) are always used to perform a *Save Clue*.
- Color clues (moo) must always be *Play Clues*.

### Reverse Finesse Restriction

- It is illegal to perform a *Reverse Finesse* with a rank clue on the first turn. (This makes things more clear for players when they are given a *Save Clue* and there are some playable cards on *Finesse Position* to get.)

### Advanced Conventions

- In Cow & Pig variants, *Ejections* and *Discharges* work quite differently. See the [Specific Conventions for Variants with No Positive Clues](no-positive-clues.md).
