These conventions apply to the "Deceptive-Ones" variants.

### Prompting 1's

- In this variant, it is possible to have 1's in a player's hand that are "misranked".
- _Finesses_ in this variant work the same as in a regular pink variant: play _Finesse Position_ instead of a potentially misranked 1.
