These conventions apply to the "Clue Starved" variants.

### The Bomb Finesse

- This convention only applies to *Clue Starved* variants.
- In these variants, giving a *Fix Clue* is not worth it if the team has less than 2 strikes and only one misplay will happen (on a non-critical card).
- Following from this, if a *Layered Finesse* with a *Lie Component* is needed, it is better to **not** give the *Fix Clue* and just let them get the strike.
- Players who get a strike in this way would normally stop playing into the *Finesse*, knowing that something has gone wrong. But in *Clue Starved*, they should keep going, knowing that the strike (bomb) was intentional.
