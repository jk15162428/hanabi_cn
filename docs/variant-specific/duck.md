These conventions apply to the "Duck" variants.

<br />

### Chop Saves

- All clues to chop are treated as *Save Clues*.

### Relaxed 2 Saves

- It is optional for players to give *Save Clues* to 2's.
- Thus, if a 2 is discarded, players should not make any *Elimination Notes* for them.

### Inverted Tempo Clues

- Normally, if a *Save Clue* is given to two cards, and then the cards are re-touched, it is a *Double Tempo Clue* and both the cards should play from left to right, even if one of the cards was on chop.
- In Duck, the older card should play first. (This is exactly the same thing as the *[Brown Inversion](brown.md#brown-tempo-clue-inversion)* convention.)

### Loaded Play Clues

- *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned on" in Duck variants. Furthermore, *Loaded Play Clues* are even turned on in the *Early Game*.

### The Loaded Finesse

- In addition to the above rule, players are also not allowed to give a *Save Clue* to a someone if that someone has a playable card that could be clued instead.
- If the chop card is clued in this scenario, it is instead treated a *Chop-Focus Loaded Play Clue*. However, the player receiving the clue will not know this, and will treat it as a normal *Save Clue*. Thus, a *Loaded Play Clue* given in this scenario must be a *Loaded Finesse*.
- As an exception to the rule, players are allowed to give a *Save Clue* if the *Play Clue* would violate *Good Touch Principle*.

### The 1's Promise

- Players must use the number 1 clue to clue 1's in a player's opening hand.
- Thus, if a player gets a *Play Clue* that touches two cards, and then they play the left-most card and it is a 1, they can know that the other one is for-sure a 1 and should play it on the next turn.
- If 3 or more 1's were clued with the original clue, then the play order should be from left to right.

### The 1's Promise Play Lie

- Players can be tricked into playing cards by using the *1's Promise*. For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice clues Bob about two cards on slot 1 and slot 2.
  - Bob plays slot 1. It is a red 1.
  - Bob knows that because of the *1's Promise, the card on his slot 2 must also be a 1.
  - When it gets to Bob's turn, Bob plays his slot 2, and it is a red 2 instead of a 1.
- If there are additional cards in the hand that were touched by the original clue, then once the *1's Promise Play Lie* is revealed, players should stop playing those cards.
- For example, in 3-player game:
  - Alice clues Bob about three cards on slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  - Bob plays slot 1. It is a red 1.
  - Bob knows that because of the *1's Promise*, the cards on his slot 2 and slot 3 must also be a 1.
  - When it gets to Bob's turn, Bob plays his slot 2, and it is a red 2 instead of a 1.
  - Bob knows that his slot 3 card must be a red card. However, it is not necessarily the red 3, and is equally likely to be either a red 3, a red 4, or a red 5.

### The 1's Promise Play Lie Finesse

- It is also possible to *Finesse* other players by using the *1's Promise*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice clues Bob about two cards on slot 1 and slot 2.
  - Bob plays slot 1. It is a red 1.
  - Bob knows that because of the *1's Promise*, the card on his slot 2 must also be a 1.
  - Cathy sees that Bob was clued about a red 1 and a red 3 as a red clue. Cathy also sees that it was possible to give a "clean" number 1 clue to Bob to only get the red 1.
  - Cathy knows that Bob's clue choice was quite strange: because of the *1's Promise*, Bob will misplay the red 3 when it gets to his turn. Thus, this must be a *Finesse*.
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* as red 2.

### Advanced Conventions

- In Duck variants, *Ejections* and *Discharges* work quite differently. See the [Specific Conventions for Variants with No Positive Clues](no-positive-clues.md).
