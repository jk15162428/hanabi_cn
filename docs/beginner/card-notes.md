在游玩花火的时候，你需要做一点*笔记*。这一页会告诉你缘由。如果你并不急于了解原因，你可以先跳过此页，在自己心中有答案后回来比对。

## 显式与隐式信息

- In Hanabi, players will know *explicit* information and *implicit* information about the cards in their hand:
  - *Explicit* information is from the clues "on" the card.
  - *Implicit* information is from the context of the game *when* the card was clued.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game.
  - Alice clues Bob red, touching a card on his slot 1. Alice intends for this to be a *Play Clue*, signaling to Bob that he has a red 1 and that he should play it on the stacks right now.
  - From Bob's perspective, he knows that *explicitly*, his red card can be red 1, red 2, red 3, red 4, or red 5.
  - But Bob also knows that *implicitly*, Alice intends for him to play this red card, so it must be exactly the red 1.

## 玩家需要获取隐式信息

- On [Hanab Live](https://hanab.live/), the interface automatically will keep track of clues that touch cards. And the interface will automatically narrow down the identities of the cards as they "get" more clues.
- However, this automated tracking of *explicit* information is not sufficient - there is a lot more *implicit* information than *explicit* information.
- In Hanabi games where players only give basic *Play Clues* to each other (like in the previous example), remembering all of the *implicit* information about the cards is easy. But as games get more and more complicated, remembering *implicit* information about every card in the game is impossible.
- Thus, in order to play Hanabi properly, players **must** go above and beyond the automated *explicit* tracking and record all of the implicit information themselves.

## 记笔记

- Handily, Hanab Live allows players to track *implicit* information on a card by right-clicking on it. This pops up a text box, allowing players to record any information that they want. This is called a *card note*.
- **After every single clue, players should record a note on the affected card.**
- In the previous example, Bob should right-click on his red card and write "red 1", so that he doesn't forget for later.
- Furthermore, Alice and Cathy should **also** right-click on Bob's red card and write "red 1", so that they can keep track of what Bob thinks about the card. In this way, **everybody writes notes on everybody's cards.**

## 避免失误

- Since the red clue above was so simple, you may think that writing a note of "red 1" is silly and a waste of time. However, realize that Bob **might not play the red 1 for many, many turns**, at which point the game state may have dramatically changed.
- The most common beginner mistake that we see is failing to write a note on a card, and then forgetting some piece of information later on in the game.
- Do not forget to do this! Write *card notes* after **every single clue**, no matter how simple or complicated it is!
