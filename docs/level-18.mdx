## 规定

<br />

### Elimination & Elimination Notes（排除法与排除笔记）

- 通常而言，你的队友一定不会让你弃掉任何重要的牌。所以在你弃掉一些可以打出的牌（比如可以打出的 2）**且**这张牌并不在其他玩家的手中时，你会觉得队伍有人犯了错误。
- 根据「High Value Principle」，你永远不应该假设自己的队友犯了错。如果队友让你弃掉了重要的卡牌，一个非常合理的解释是你手里还有另一张它的复制牌。（为了符合「Good Touch Principle」，他们必须等你弃掉一张，这样才不会产生复制牌。）
- 因此，当你接下来得到提示的时候，你就可以知道它到底是什么牌。
- 譬如说，在一局三人游戏中：
  - 红 3 已经被打出。
  - Alice 手中没有任何提示过的牌。
  - Alice 弃掉了 chop（5 号槽位）上的牌，这是一张（可以打出的）红 4。
  - Alice 很惊讶 - 她知道队伍里的其他成员不会让彼此弃掉可以打出的牌（根据「Save Principle」）。
  - Alice 知道队伍并不在一个很紧急的情况下，唯一的解释就是她手里有另一张红 4。
  - Alice 在自己的 2 号、3 号、4 号和 5 号槽位记下了“r4?”的笔记。（不可能会在 1 号槽位，因为她刚刚才抽到这张牌。）
  - Bob 向 Alice 提示了红色，点到了 1 号和 2 号槽位的牌。
  - 通常情况下，Alice 会将最左端（1 号槽位）的牌当成红 4 打出。但是，根据她的笔记，她知道红 4 其实是在 2 号槽位上。
  - Alice 成功从 2 号槽位打出了红 4。现在红 5 是唯一还有用的红色卡牌，Alice 会认为自己的另一张红色牌是红 5（根据「Good Touch Principle」，她在下一回合就可以将其打出。

<EliminationNotes />

- 在这个例子中，Alice 的“r4?”笔记就被称为「Elimination Notes」（排除笔记）。「Elimination Notes」是为某张特定的卡表示可能的位置所使用的笔记。
- 在这个例子中，触发「Elimination Notes」记录的“事情”是弃牌，所以这也被称为「Discard Elimination」。
- 注意，玩家不应该每次弃掉可以打出的牌时都做「Elimination Notes」。有些情况下，游戏可能会非常复杂，没有一个合理的方式可以保住某些可以打出的牌。玩家们应该用自己的优良判断能力思考这个问题。

<br />

### Double Discard Elimination

- 当一名玩家在「Double Discard」情况下选择弃牌，但他明明看得到有一个显而易见的提示可以给（比如「5 Stall」），这暗示着他们“看见”了那张牌的另一张复制，所以自己根本就不在「Double Discard」情况中。
- 因此，这种情况发生时，你应该在你的所有手牌上记下「Elimination Notes」。
- 除了是由另一名玩家弃牌触发的，这与「Discard Elimination」几乎没有区别。

### 2 Elimination

- 根据「Save Principle」，每名玩家都知道所有的 2 都应该保存下来。因此，如果有名玩家选择让一张 2 被弃掉，这是很奇怪的。
- 如果没有其他特殊的情况发生，那么这就是一个信号，其他人手里有另一张 2，所以应该在他们的手牌上写下「Elimination Notes」。

<br />

## 特殊操作

<br />

### The Elimination Blind-Play（排除法盲打）

- 首先，请阅读「[Elimination](#elimination--elimination-notes（排除法与排除笔记）)」这一部分。
- 在「Discard Elimination」的例子中，队伍直接提示了另一张红 4。但有些时候，队伍并**不会**提示任何东西。写有「Elimination Notes」的玩家可以逐个排除掉可能性。当只剩下一种可能性时，他们就可以使用「Elimination Blind-Play」直接盲打出那张牌。
- 比如说，在一局三人游戏中：
  - 红 3 已经被打出。
  - Alice 手中没有任何提示过的牌。
  - Alice 弃掉了 chop（5 号槽位）上的牌。这是一张（可以打出的）红 4。
  - Alice 知道队伍并不在一个很紧急的情况下，唯一的解释就是她手里有另一张红 4。
  - Alice 在自己的 2 号、3 号、4 号和 5 号槽位记下了“r4?”的笔记。（不可能会在 1 号槽位，因为她刚刚才抽到这张牌。）
  - Bob 向 Alice 提示了蓝色，点到了 1 号、2 号、3 号和 4 号槽位的牌。（这是在 1 号槽位上的「Play Clue」。）
  - Alice 在 1 号槽位记下了“blue 1”。
  - Alice 去掉了写在 2 号、3 号和 4 号槽位上的"r4"笔记。
  - 现在还留有「Elimination Note」的牌只有 5 号槽位了。
  - 轮到 Alice 的回合时，她可以使用「Elimination Blind-Play」直接打出红 4。

<EliminationBlindPlay />

### The Elimination Play Clue（排除法打出提示）

- 一个点到多张牌的提示只有一个 focus。你应该知道的，如果 chop 上的牌没有被点到，那 focus 就在最左侧的牌。
- 然而，如果根据「Elimination」这个提示单独排出了一张牌，那这个规则就不适用了。这种情况下，只有「Elimination」排除而出的那张牌是 focus，其他所有被点到的牌都不保证现在是能打出的。
- 比如说，在一局三人游戏中：
  - 红 1 和蓝 1 都已被打出。
  - Alice 的 3 号槽位和 5 号槽位都是红 2。（Alice 的 chop 是 5 号槽位。）
  - Alice 弃掉了 chop 上的牌，这是一张红 2。
  - Alice 很惊讶，并在 2 号、3 号、4 号和 5 号槽位上记下了红 2 的「Elimination Notes」。
  - Bob 向 Alice 提示了数字 2，点到了 1 号和 4 号槽位。
  - 通常而言，Alice 会认为在 1 号槽位上的「Play Clue」。但是，她知道自己的 4 号槽位肯定是红 2（她现在就可以打出这张牌）。
  - 因此，Alice 知道这个提示的目的就是为了获得红 2。1 号槽位的 2 可以是任意一张其他的 2，现在并不保证能被打出。

<EliminationPlayClue />

### Interaction Between Elimination & Chop-Focus

- 有时，玩家的手牌中有两张或更多的牌有「Elimination Notes」。通过后续给这些玩家提示，他们可以用「Elimination」排出某张卡是什么。
- 提示可以使用「positive information」（正向信息）或使用「negative information」（负向信息）来帮助「Elimination」的使用。

#### Example of an Elimination Single-Out Using a Clue With Positive Information

- See the section on the _[Elimination Play Clue](#the-elimination-play-clue)_:
  - In the example for _Elimination Play Clue_, Alice receives a 2 clue.
  - After getting the 2 clue, Alice deletes the _Elimination Notes_ on her slot 2, slot 3, and slot 5.
  - Thus, Alice has completely narrowed down the identity of the red 2 to be in slot 4.

#### Example of an Elimination Single-Out Using a Clue With Negative Information

- For example, in 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice discards red 2. She writes _Elimination Notes_ for red 2 on slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.
  - Bob clues number 3 to Alice, touching three 3's on slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4.
  - After getting the number 3 clue, Alice deletes the _Elimination Notes_ on her slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4.
  - Thus, Alice has completely narrowed down the identity of the red 2 to be in slot 5.

#### Chop-Focus Happens **Before** Clues Are Given

- When a clue is given that singles out an _Elimination_ card with _negative information_, then the focus of the clue should be evaluated normally.
- In other words, the focused slot should be evaluated **before** the clue was given, just like how every other clue works.
- For example, continuing on from the previous example:
  - Alice also knows that Bob's number 3 clue must be a _Play Clue_ on the red 3 (since red 1 is on the only 1 currently played and there are no 3's in the trash).
  - But which slot is Bob's clue focusing? In other words, which slot is promised to be red 3?
  - The clue is either focused on slot 2 (the newest of the clued cards) or slot 4 (the "new" chop after the red 2 is accounted for).
  - Alice knows that you evaluate where the chop is **before** clues are given, so the clue must be focused on slot 2.

### The Elimination Riding Deduction

- If:
  - there are only two cards left in a player's hand with _Elimination Notes_ **and**
  - the previous players let the chop card ride **and**
  - the previous players were not busy, **then**
- The card with the _Elimination Note_ card cannot be on the chop! (Otherwise, one of the previous players would have clued it with either a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_ in order to prevent it from being discarded.)
- In such a situation, the player with the _Elimination Notes_ can "jump ahead" and immediately blind-play the newest of the two cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 has been played on the red stack.
  - Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice discards her chop (slot 5). It is a (playable) red 2.
  - Alice knows that the team was not busy, so she must have the other copy of red 2.
  - Alice writes _Elimination Notes_ on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. She discards, and now has _Elimination Notes_ on slots 3, 4, and 5.
  - Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. She discards, and now has _Elimination Notes_ on slots 4 and 5.
  - Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. Her teammates would not let the other copy of red 2 be discarded, so it must be on slot 4. Alice blind-plays red 2 from slot 4.

<EliminationRidingDeduction />

### The Riding Bluff

- Typically, when a player has two cards with _Elimination Notes_ and the "true" copy of the card is on chop, you must clue it to let them know.
- However, if the other card is also playable, you can choose to not clue anything.
- Next, the player should perform an _Elimination Riding Deduction_, and play the unrelated card.
- After that, there will be only one card left with an _Elimination Note_, so they will go on to play the "true" card on their next turn.

<br />

### The Elimination Self-Chop Move

- Sometimes, a player will have narrowed down their _Elimination Notes_ to one specific card. Thus, even if the card happens to have no positive clues on it, the player will know the exact identity of the card.
- In this situation, the player should _Self-Chop Move_ the card. In other words, since the _Elimination Notes_ were globally known, there is no need for someone on the team to waste a clue to prevent the discard of the card.

<br />

### The Elimination Finesse

- Normally, if a player is _Finessed_, they are supposed to play their _Finesse Position_ card. However, what if they have _Elimination Notes_ on their hand for the specific card that is _Finessed_?
- In most situations, there will not be an _Elimination Note_ on slot 1 (e.g. the _Finesse Position_). This means that playing slot 1 into the _Finesse_ would not make any sense.
  - However, in the rare case where there is an _Elimination Note_ on their _Finesse Position_, then the player should **still** not play the _Finesse Position_; read on.
- Here, the player is expected to play the **oldest** of the cards with the _Elimination Notes_ on them (not counting _Chop Moved_ cards, if any).
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Blue 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice discards a blue 3. Blue 3 was playable, and nothing urgent is currently happening, so she writes _Elimination Notes_ on her hand for the other blue 3 on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - Bob clues Cathy blue, which touches a blue 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice knows that this is some sort of _Reverse Finesse_, as it is calling for the blue 3. However, the blue 3 cannot be in her _Finesse Position_ (slot 1), as she knows from the _Elimination Notes_ that it must be either on slot 2, 3, 4, or 5. So it must instead be a _Reverse Elimination Finesse_.
  - The _Elimination Finesse_ promises that it is her oldest card, so she plays slot 5 as blue 3.

<EliminationFinesse />

- As mentioned above, _Chop Moved_ cards should be skipped over when finding the _Elimination Finesse_ target. If there are two or more cards with _Elimination Notes_ on them and they are all _Chop Moved_, then the oldest _Chop Moved_ card should be played.
- _Elimination Finesses_ apply to **all** types of situations with _Elimination Notes_ (including _Double Discard Elimination Notes_). Subsequently, you can more specifically describe an _Elimination Finesse_ as a _Discard Elimination Finesse_ or a _Double Discard Elimination Finesse_.
- Note that normal _Finesses_ take priority over _Self-Elimination Finesses_. For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice's hand is completely unclued. Alice has _Elimination Notes_ on slot 3 and slot 4 for red 3.
  - Cathy clues a number 4 in Alice's slot 1 as a _Self-Finesse_.
  - If Alice's 4 is a blue 4, then this would be a normal _Self-Finesse_, and Alice should blind-play blue 3 from slot 2.
  - If Alice's 4 is a red 4, then this would be an _Elimination Self-Finesse_, and Alice should blind-play red 3 from slot 4.
  - Alice knows that in this situation, you always supposed to assume a normal _Finesse_, so she blind-plays blue 3 from slot 2.

<EliminationFinesse2 />

### Trash Touch Elimination

- Players carefully choose between using a color clue and a number clue in order to avoid violating _Good Touch Principle_. Sometimes, when both a color clue **and** a number would violate _Good Touch Principle_, players are forced to pick between the lesser of two evils.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 4, red 3, blue 4, blue 4, blue 1`
  - If Alice needs to clue the red 4 **right now** for some reason, she would be screwed. If she clues red, she would duplicate the red 3. If she clues number 4, she would duplicate the blue 4. Both are bad.
  - So, Alice has to choose between the lesser of two evils and chooses to clue number 4 as a _Play Clue_ on the red 4.
  - Bob plays the red 4.
  - Now, Cathy has to interpret what happened. Normally, Alice duplicating the blue 4 would mean that she is making a mistake or something else special is going on. However, in this situation, Cathy knows that Alice had to choose between two evils, so the number 4 clue is considered to be ordinary.
- In some situations, players you can see that it **is** possible to use a color or number clue to uniquely touch a clue target without "picking up" extra bad cards. So if a clue is given that does so anyway, it is conveying an extra special message.
- When this occurs, and there is exactly one "missing" card, players should write an _Elimination Note_ in their hand for the missing card. This is called _Trash Touch Elimination_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 and all the other 1s are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 4, red 1, blue 1, green 1, yellow 1`
  - Alice wants to give a play clue to the red 4. Everyone else on the team (other than Bob) can see that she can give either number 4 or red.
    - If Alice clues number 4, then it will uniquely touch the red 4 (which will satisfy _Good Touch Principle_).
    - If Alice clues red, then it will touch the red 4 and the red 1 (which will **violate** _Good Touch Principle_).
  - Alice clues red to Bob. Since nothing was stopping her from cluing number 4, this is very strange.
  - Bob plays the red 4.
  - There is only one "missing" red card - the red 5. Cathy knows that normally, Bob would think that his red 1 is the red 5 (from _Good Touch Principle_). This must mean that Cathy has the red 5. Cathy writes _Trash Touch Elimination Notes_ on her hand for the red 5.
