In most games, you stop becoming concerned with efficiency and become more concerned with <em>Tempo</em> - every card needs to play <strong>right now</strong> before the game ends!</li><li>Thus, since clues can mean different things depending on whether you are in the <em>Mid-Game</em> or the <em>End-Game</em>, you need to be able to keep track of when the <em>End-Game</em> has arrived.</li><li><em>Pace</em> is used to determine <em>End-Game</em> status. If pace is <strong>less than the number of players</strong>, the <em>End-Game</em> has arrived.<ul><li>On <a href="https://hanab.live" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hanab Live</a>, pace will turn yellow when this occurs.</li></ul></li><li>If pace is <strong>less than the number of players / 2</strong>, you should be very careful with discarding. It might still be the best thing to do, but if there are enough clues in the bank, it is usually better to <em>Burn</em> a clue (meaning to deliberately waste a clue).</li><li>If pace is 0, no more discards can happen in order to get the maximum score.</li><li>If pace is below 0, it is impossible to get the maximum score.</li></ul><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="no-chop-moves-in-the-end-game">No Chop Moves in the End-Game<a class="hash-link" href="#no-chop-moves-in-the-end-game" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>In the <em>Early Game</em> and the <em>Mid-Game</em>, it is often useful to <em>Chop Move</em> a card for later. The strategic point of a <em>Chop Move</em> is that it saves a potentially important card for later on.</li><li>In the <em>End-Game</em>, it does not make any sense to save a card for later, because there is no &quot;later&quot; - the team has run out of time! For this reason, <em>Chop Moves</em> are &quot;turned off&quot; in the <em>End-Game</em>.</li><li>If a player gives a clue that looks like a <em>Chop Move</em> in the <em>End-Game</em>, then players should reinterpret it as the next-simplest possible interpretation. In practice, this usually means a <em>Stall Clue</em>.</li></ul><br><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="special-moves">Special Moves<a class="hash-link" href="#special-moves" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-positional-discard-indicating-a-play-with-a-discard">The Positional Discard (Indicating a Play with a Discard)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-positional-discard-indicating-a-play-with-a-discard" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, when players discard, they discard their chop card, because discarding anything else could lose an important card.</li><li>However, this does not apply at the end of the game. At the end of the game, if a player can see every card, then they can infer that all of the unknown cards in their hand are just trash. Subsequently, players in this situation can discard any card that they want, and it won&#x27;t make a difference.</li><li>Thus, players in this situation can communicate information based on which card they discard. We agree that if a player discards a weird slot, it communicates that the chosen slot matches a slot in someone else&#x27;s hand that should be blind-played. This is called a <em>Positional Discard</em>.</li><li>One <em>Positional Discard</em> gets one blind-play from another player.</li><li>After a <em>Positional Discard</em>, if two or more players have a playable card on the same slot, then the blind-play is always targeted at the final player with the playable card.</li></ul><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-positional-misplay-indicating-a-play-with-a-misplay">The Positional Misplay (Indicating a Play with a Misplay)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-positional-misplay-indicating-a-play-with-a-misplay" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Sometimes, a player will want to perform a <em>Positional Discard</em>, but it won&#x27;t work because the other player will interpret it as a normal discard.</li><li>For example, in a 4-player game:<ul><li>All the 4&#x27;s are played on the stacks.</li><li>There are 2 cards left in the deck.</li><li>Alice has 0 clues available.</li><li>Alice sees that every card needed by the team is currently present in other player&#x27;s hands.</li><li>Alice has no clued cards in her hand. Thus, her chop is slot 4.</li><li>Donald has an unclued red 5 on his slot 4.</li></ul></li><li>In this example, if Alice tried to perform a <em>Positional Discard</em> from slot 4, it would not work, because Donald expects Alice to discard slot 4.</li><li>In order to more strongly communicate the &quot;play this slot&quot; message, players in this situation can instead misplay their chop card. Since the rest of the team can see that the card misplayed for &quot;no reason&quot;, they can deduce that it was a <em>Positional Misplay</em>.</li><li>One <em>Positional Misplay</em> gets one blind-plays from another player (as long as the <em>Positional Misplay</em> was needed because a <em>Positional Discard</em> wouldn&#x27;t work).</li></ul><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-double-positional-misplay-indicating-two-plays-with-a-misplay">The Double Positional Misplay (Indicating Two Plays with a Misplay)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-double-positional-misplay-indicating-two-plays-with-a-misplay" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, the <em>Positional Misplay</em> is used as a last-resort when a <em>Positional Discard</em> would not work. But what if a player does a <em>Positional Misplay</em> anyway, even if a normal <em>Positional Discard</em> would have worked? The player must be trying to communicate something extra.</li><li>We agree that the &quot;extra message&quot; is that two cards are promised to be playable instead of just one.</li><li>One <em>Positional Misplay</em> gets two blind-plays from the team (as long as it was &quot;unnecessary&quot;).</li></ul><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-distribution-clue">The Distribution Clue<a class="hash-link" href="#the-distribution-clue" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>In the <em>End-Game</em>, when a player has many playable cards, there is the risk that they will not be able to play all cards before the end of the game.</li><li>Thus, it might make sense to spend a clue to duplicate one of their playable cards in someone else&#x27;s hand. This would violate <em>Good Touch Principle</em>, but it would relieve the player with the loaded hand from some of the card-playing burden.</li><li>Since it distributes plays more evenly throughout the team, this is called a <em>Distribution Clue</em>. <em>Distribution Clues</em> better satisfy <em>Team Distribution Principle</em>.</li></ul><br><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="general-principles">General Principles<a class="hash-link" href="#general-principles" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="team-distribution-principle">Team Distribution Principle<a class="hash-link" href="#team-distribution-principle" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>In general, it is better for useful cards to be distributed <strong>evenly</strong> throughout the team. This is especially important in 5-player games.</li><li>Thus, if one of your teammates has 3 out of 4 cards clued, it may be better for <strong>them</strong> to be the one giving the clues, and you to be the one discarding - even if their chop is known-trash.</li><li>There are multiple reasons for this. First, you don&#x27;t want them to get a <em>Locked Hand</em>, which is generally bad. Second, if they continue to draw playable cards, the game may end before they get a chance to play them all.</li></ul><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-pace-1-rule">The Pace +1 Rule<a class="hash-link" href="#the-pace-1-rule" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Players can use <em>Pace</em> to determine if it is safe to discard. In general, a group can discard down to pace 0 and still get a perfect score.</li><li>However, as a rule, if pace is +1 and one of the players on your team <strong>does not</strong> have any playable cards, then you cannot discard - <strong>you must let them perform the final discard</strong>.</li><li>If both you and another player do not have any playable cards, then you can do the final discard - the team won&#x27;t be able to get a perfect score anyway. But if you <strong>could</strong> have an unknown playable card in your hand, then you should be very careful about discarding, because it could ruin a perfect score.</li></ul><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="burning-end-game-stalling">Burning (End-Game Stalling)<a class="hash-link" href="#burning-end-game-stalling" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>In the <em>End-Game</em>, often times there are still a lot of cards yet to be played. Thus, you need to be very careful when discarding, since by drawing a card you can make the game end before everyone has a chance to play all of the cards.</li><li>If there are enough clues available, you can choose to stall, by giving a low-value clue (or even a completely useless clue). This is referred to as <em>Burning</em> a clue.</li><li>The best way to give a useless clue is to re-clue cards which are already known to be playable.</li><li>Give a <em>Burn Clue</em> if:<ul><li>There is a possibility that the game can be completed without anyone discarding from now on.</li><li>You have two or more useful cards in your hand, and you want to follow <em>Team Distribution Principle</em>.</li></ul></li><li>Do not give a <em>Burn Clue</em> if:<ul><li>The end-game has not started yet (see the <em>End-Game Threshold</em>).</li><li>You know that someone else will have to discard in the future.</li></ul></li></ul><br><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="end-game-strategy">End-Game Strategy<a class="hash-link" href="#end-game-strategy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>The previous three sections introduce the <em>End-Game</em> at a high-level. When the <em>End-Game</em> arrives, you should probably be changing the way you play.</li><li>However, giving specific advice for the <em>End-Game</em> is very difficult - things vary widely based on the deal and there are a lot of different things to consider.</li><li>So, you will need to think through each <em>End-Game</em> yourself, one step at a time. Ask questions like:<ul><li>Which cards are left in the deck that we need?</li><li>What is the probability of drawing those cards?</li><li>Who should be drawing those cards?</li><li>Does stalling produce a line that is better than playing?</li></ul></li></ul></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/jk15162428/hanabi_cn/edit/master/docs/level-7.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_dcUD" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_foO9"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_cNA8 thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#conventions" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Conventions</a><ul><li><a href="#end-game-threshold" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">End-Game Threshold</a></li><li><a href="#no-chop-moves-in-the-end-game" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">No Chop Moves in the End-Game</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#special-moves" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Special Moves</a><ul><li><a href="#the-positional-discard-indicating-a-play-with-a-discard" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Positional Discard (Indicating a Play with a Discard)</a></li><li><a href="#the-positional-misplay-indicating-a-play-with-a-misplay" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Positional Misplay (Indicating a Play with a Misplay)</a></li><li><a href="#the-double-positional-misplay-indicating-two-plays-with-a-misplay" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Double Positional Misplay (Indicating Two Plays with a Misplay)</a></li><li><a href="#the-distribution-clue" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Distribution Clue</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#general-principles" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">General Principles</a><ul><li><a href="#team-distribution-principle" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Team Distribution Principle</a></li><li><a href="#the-pace-1-rule" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Pace +1 Rule</a></li><li><a href="#burning-end-game-stalling" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Burning (End-Game Stalling)</a></li><li><a href="#end-game-strategy" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">End-Game Strategy</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div>
