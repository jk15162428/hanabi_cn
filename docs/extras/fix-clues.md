### The Just-In-Time Fix Clue (JIT)

- When performing a *Layered Finesse* with a *Lie Component*, if the plan is to give a *Fix Clue* to the *Finesse Target* card (the "final" card that is to be blind-played), then it is important to wait until the **last** moment to give the *Fix Clue*. This is because after receiving the *Fix Clue*, the player will not play any more blind cards.
- Thus, you should first wait for all of the "good" blind cards to play, and **then** give the *Fix Clue* to the *Finesse Target*, so that it comes "just in time" before the misplay.
- Alternatively, if the plan is to give a *Fix Clue* to some **other** card than the *Finesse Target* (e.g. a number 5 clue to a 5 in the middle of the hand), then the *Fix Clue* does not necessarily have to be just in time. It can be done early, and the player will know that they have to continue blind-playing cards until they find the *Finesse Target*.

### The Speed-up Clue

- The *Layered Finesse* convention (and its derivatives) are very efficient (in terms of "X-for-1"). However, sometimes it can be very slow (low-*Tempo*), as players will have to allow for all possible *Reverse Finesses* before playing anything. This is generally not a problem in 3-player games, but *Tempo* is important in 5-player games.
- Normally, when the *Finesse Target* (the card that is to be blind-played) is clued directly, it is a mistake due to someone not paying close enough attention. We refer to this as *Stomping on a Finesse*.
- However, if high-*Tempo* is needed, a player can consider intentionally *stomping* on a *Layered Finesse* in order to "speed up" the play of a specific card that leads into other players hands.
- One complicating factor of the *Speed-up Clue* is how to differentiate it from a more-ordinary *Fix Clue*. In other words, after the clued card is played, on their next turn, should the player go back and blind-play the other cards? If it was a *Speed-up Clue*, they should. If it was a *Fix Clue*, they should not.
- The key lies in the context of the clue:
  - Was it possible to take an equivalent line where a *Fix Clue* would not be needed? (In terms of the same number of clues, and no risk of discarding critical/playable cards.) If yes, then it is a *Speed-up Clue*.
  - Is the timing of the *Fix Clue* appropriate? If not, then it might be a *Speed Up* clue.
