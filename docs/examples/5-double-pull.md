The *[5 Double Pull](/extras/pushes-pulls.md#the-5-double-pull-or-the-double-5-pull)* is a level 19 convention.

<br />

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](/img/examples/5-double-pull.png)

- It is Dr_Kakashi's turn.
- Dr_Kakashi clues number 5 to invarse. That touches the blue 5. Since the blue 5 is one-away from chop, invarse will think that this is a *5's Chop Move*.
- The next player is micerang. Micerang knows that performing a *5's Chop Move* on a playable red 2 is nonsensical, since if Dr_Kakashi had instead clued red to invarse, then invarse would play the red 2 immediately.
- Micerang knows that since this is the *Early Game* and a playable card was *5's Chop Moved*, this must be a *5 Double Pull*. Micerang plays his *Finesse Position* card (slot 1). It is a yellow 1 and it successfully plays.
- The next player is invarse. Invarse knows that since a *5's Chop Move* got micerang to blind-play his *Finesse Position*, this must be a *5 Double Pull*. invarse blind-plays the *Chop Moved* card (slot 2). It is a red 2 and it successfully plays.
