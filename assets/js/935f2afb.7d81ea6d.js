We play Hanabi a lot, using the Hanab Live website and a Discord server to get pick-up games going. Everything doesn\'t always go perfectly, but we strive to constantly improve. Naturally, we have also built up a set of conventions that we all agree upon at the beginning of the game so that it is easier to understand what everyone else is doing. As the list of conventions got longer, we wanted to make sure that everything was documented in an official capacity.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"beginner":{"id":"beginner","title":"\u5f15\u8a00","description":"\u5f15\u8a00","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"beginner/2-save":{"id":"beginner/2-save","title":"The 2
